APP-CALENDAR-RDATE
==================

This is a port of OpenBSD's rdate utility to OS/2. rdate displays and sets the local date and time from the host name or address given as the argument. The time source may be an RFC868 TCP protocol server, which is usually implemented as a built-in service of inetd 8, or an RFC1361 protocol SNTP/NTP server.
